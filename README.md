This repository contains the code I wrote for tackling project 1 in the Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Dataset

In this project I used the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2017 & 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). It contains the survey answers from the annual developer surveys of said years.

## Questions Answered

I tried to answer the following questions:

**Question 1**<br>
How well can I predict my own salary, using the answers I would give to the survey.

**Question 2**<br>
Which coefficients does my linear regression use to predict a salary and which of these could I use myself to increase my salary in the future.

**Question 3**<br>
Using the 2020 survey, which are the data focussed programming languages and frameworks that I could focus my learning on.



## Deployment

The code can be run with Jupyter Notebooks after cloning the repository without any further requirements. It uses Python 3.

## Built With
